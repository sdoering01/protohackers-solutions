# Protohackers Solutions

These are my solutions for the [Protohackers](https://protohackers.com/)
challenges in various programming languages.

To run the solutions, change into the corresponding directory and use the
following commands (you obviously need to have the corresponding toolchains
installed):

- **Rust**: `cargo run --release`
- **Elixir**: `mix run --no-halt`
- **C**: `gcc -Wall -O3 -o out <input-file> && ./out` (for simple one-file
  solutions)
